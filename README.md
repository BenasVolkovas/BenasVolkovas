## Hi, I am Benas
- I'm a blockchain developer and entrepreneur passionate about startups, indie hacking, investments, and web3.
- I started my coding journey at the age of 13.
- I landed my first job as a web3/blockchain developer during the 11th grade.
- After completing the 12th grade, I intentionally chose the path of becoming a self-taught developer over attending university.
- I am currently employed as a blockchain developer at "SUPER HOW?".
- Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benas-volkovas/)
